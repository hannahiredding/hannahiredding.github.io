      <p>I am currently a senior at Cornell University in the School of Industrial and
    Labor Relations. While I'm passionate about the work and educational experiences
    included in the <a class="biolinks" href="education.html">
    education</a>, <a class="biolinks" href="work.html">work</a>,
    and <a class="biolinks" href="leadership.html">leadership</a> pages, there
    is so much more to know
    about me. I am passionate about social justice issues, especially criminal justice reform,
    feminism, and inequality. Because of this, I follow politics
    religiously and can be found most of the time watching the Daily Show or listening
    to Revisionist History podcasts. I'm also passionate about music, new and old.
    Some of my favorite artists include Frank Ocean,  Neil Young, and Nina Simone.
    I consider myself a creative person and I love writing, travelling, sketching,
    and photography. Every photo featured on this website I took in a different city that
    I've travelled to. Another trait central to who I am is my innate curiousity.
    Every year at Cornell, I take a class in something that I know
    nothing about, ranging from a class on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
    to a class on veganism, to a class on web design and coding
    (what ultimately allowed me to design and develop this website from scratch).
    Going forward,I hope to pursue a career in a field that allows me to continue
    to explore and satisfy
    my curiosity, while making an impact on the world.</p>
